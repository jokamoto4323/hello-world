# hello-world
This is my first test on github

Until now i didn't know how to code, I'm 22 old. I live in Brazil and I don't have brothers. I just want to learn code because I'm feeling that code is a future. And one interesting thing is that we are in May, 26 of 2020. In a middle of pandemic called covid-19 that cannot allow us to go out with friends. So I decided to learn code.
